# Employee Salary Monitor #
## Done Individually ##

This project has been done using **node.js**.

Simply, it sends an email to some users based on condition on the latest inserted employee salary.
If the employee salary is greater than his/her manager, an email is sent to some users notifying them by that error associated with employee SSN to revise his/her data.


It monitors the database behavior using a trigger that compares the newely inserted salary with employee's manager's salary.
