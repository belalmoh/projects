# Playfair Encryption Algorithm #
## Done Individually ##

This project has been done using **Java**.

This is a simple encryption that's done by me.

The idea of encryption is to encrypt each english letter to its spoken way. i.e: B->Bee .. C ->See and so forth for the rest of letters.

Then after encrypting the letters, reverse the first half of the word.
