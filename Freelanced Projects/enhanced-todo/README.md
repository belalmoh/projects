# Enhanced Todo System.

I'm currently developing an enhanced-todo-system.

---
## I'm Using:

* **TypeScript**
* **Ionic-2 Using Native Components**
* **AngularJs-2**
---
## What is new in this enhanced model:
* Login & Registration system with/out social media accounts.
* Todos can have items and could be shared. i.e: *me and my friend are having the same todo*
* Todos alerts you through email.
* Todos alerts you upon leaving previously chosen certain area.
